# Balatro-Mods
Install script for Mod pack of CardSauce v.1.2.1 and Mika's Mod. 

on the right side of the page, click "Releases" for download.

Windows will, of course detect this as a virus/threat.
All files installed and downloaded here are open source, and free to
look at the code. (links below).

<b>Windows install</b>

Download both files named windows-run-first.ps1 and windows-install.ps1
The windows Run first file will add the balatro Mod directory to the windows defender whitelist.

right-click the file named windows-run-first, and click run with powershell.

Next we need to disable realtime-protection before we execute the other script.

Click Start and start typing "security", and click Windows Security.

You can turn this back on after this is all done :) 

Finally run the file "windows-install", the same way we did before.
